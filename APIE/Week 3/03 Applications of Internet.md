# 03 Applications of Internet

## Introduction
- Internet spread widely after **Windows 95 (1995)** bundled **TCP/IP** for free.  
- 1995 is often considered the **first year of the Internet**.  
- The **WWW + browser (Internet Explorer)** made the Internet accessible to everyone.  

## Early Applications Driving Internet Growth
Before the WWW, three key applications contributed to the Internet’s expansion (1980s–early 1990s):

### 1. Network News (Usenet)
- Functioned as a **global online bulletin board**.  
- Posts and replies were distributed worldwide via servers.  
- Supported discussions on technology, politics, culture, etc.  
- Worked like today’s **social networks**.  
- Initially used **UUCP protocol**, later transitioned to **NNTP (port 119)**.  
- Still exists, though largely replaced by **web-based forums & social media**.  

### 2. Electronic Mail (Email)
- Based on **SMTP (1981)**, later improved with **POP (1984)** and **IMAP (1988)**.  
- Allowed individuals to have personal email addresses and global communication.  
- DNS with **MX records** used to locate mail servers.  
- By 1993, Japanese-language support was added → email became mainstream in society.  

### 3. File Sharing (FTP)
- **FTP (1985)** enabled uploading and downloading of files between client & server.  
- Widely used in research for **sharing papers, software, and data**.  
- Universities (MIT, UC Berkeley, Keio, etc.) hosted large FTP servers.  
- **Gopher protocol (1993)** improved search across multiple FTP servers.  
- **Anonymous FTP** allowed open public access without user accounts.  
- Issues: Popular sites ran out of **disk space** due to high demand.  

## World Wide Web (WWW)
- Invented in **1990**, solved FTP’s limitations.  
- Distributed system: each server stores and shares its own files.  
- Users can fetch information from different servers without relying on a single archive.  
- **WWW revolutionized Internet access** → easy, global information sharing.  

## Summary
- Internet origins: **ARPANET + UNIX (1970s)**.  
- Expansion in **1980s** driven by:
  1. Network News  
  2. Electronic Mail  
  3. File Sharing (FTP)  
- With the **WWW (1990)** and **Windows 95 (1995)**, the Internet reached society at large.  
- Applications built on **TCP/IP** transformed the Internet into a **universal communication and information platform**.
