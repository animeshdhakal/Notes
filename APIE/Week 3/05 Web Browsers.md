# 05 Web Browsers

## Introduction
- **World Wide Web (WWW)**: Often synonymous with the Internet, enabled by HTML for easy content creation.
- **Web Browsers**: Software that displays web content on devices like PCs and smartphones, key to the web's growth.

## Birth of Browsers
- **1991**: First browser, "WorldWideWeb," created by Tim Berners-Lee, ran on NeXT workstations.
- **1993**: NCSA Mosaic introduced image handling, increasing user adoption.
- **1995**: Internet Explorer 1 bundled with Windows 95, popularizing the web globally.

## Role of the Browser
1. **HTML Interpretation and Rendering**
    - Converts HTML data into visual displays on bitmap screens.
    - Core function: interpreting and rendering HTML for user viewing.
2. **Acquiring User Actions**
    - Captures input via pointing devices (mouse, touchscreen) and other inputs (microphones, webcams).
    - Enables interaction with web content through various input devices.

## End-to-End Principle
- **Web Architecture**: Divides roles between client (browser) and server.
    - Browsers handle user interface; servers process requests using computing resources.
- **Internet Design**: End systems (browsers, servers) handle most tasks, while relay systems focus on packet delivery.
- **Impact**: Rapid evolution of end systems (computers, smartphones) drives advanced Internet services.

## Development of Computers and Browsers
- **Moore’s Law**: CPU integration doubles every 18 months, driving rapid hardware advancements.
- **Smartphone Evolution**: Modern devices feature advanced screens, sensors, and communication capabilities.
- **Browser/Server Evolution**: Benefits from end system advancements, enabling dynamic Internet functionalities.

## Key Developments in Web Technology
1. **CGI (Common Gateway Interface, 1993)**
    - Allows servers to dynamically generate pages based on user input.
    - Transforms the web into a dynamic medium (e.g., shopping sites).
2. **JavaScript (1995)**
    - Embedded in browsers (first in Netscape Navigator), enables dynamic page behavior without server communication.
    - Browsers act as computers, processing JavaScript locally.
3. **Web 2.0 / Ajax (2005)**
    - **Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML)**: Enables partial page updates without full reloads.
    - Example: Dynamically updating map data based on user actions.
    - Enhances user experience with asynchronous communication.
4. **WebSocket (2011)**
    - Expands browser-server communication beyond HTTP, enabling push notifications and advanced protocols.
    - Allows browsers to connect to multiple servers, increasing flexibility.
5. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, 1994)**
    - Separates document structure (HTML) from appearance (CSS).
    - Example: Marking text as “emphasis” in HTML, styled in CSS (e.g., red, underlined, italic).
6. **HTML5 (2014)**
    - Standardizes multimedia handling (audio, video), camera, microphone, device orientation, location, and offline functionality.
    - Adapts to growing end system capabilities and mobile device needs.
